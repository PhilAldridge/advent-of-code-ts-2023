# Advent of code 2023 Typescript

My solutions to this year's Advent of Code problems. Written in typescript using starter code (source below).

## How to use
 - `npm run start X` to run the day X's test

## Credits

Some code was liberally taken from https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter after some serious head-desking to create a simple [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) starter project with Typescript.
